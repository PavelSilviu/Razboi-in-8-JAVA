# Board Game Project: Razboi in 8

## Overview
Razboi in 8 is a captivating board game designed and developed as an original idea, not found among proposed project concepts. The game is played on a chessboard and involves two players. Each player controls their own set of pieces that move diagonally, and capturing an opponent's piece involves diagonal attacks. The winner is determined by the player with the highest score.

## Project Details
I will provide an overview of the project details that I have implemented:

### File Organization
To ensure readability and easy modification, I organized the project files systematically. Resources such as images, CSS documents, media files, and FXML files generated by Scene Builder are located within the "resources" folder.

### JavaFX GUI
Opting for JavaFX was a deliberate choice, as it offered a more advanced and versatile technology compared to Swing. Its capabilities significantly enriched the visual and interactive aspects of my project.

### Database Interaction
Players are required to authenticate or register before participating in the game. To facilitate this, an Oracle database was utilized. Additionally, file handling was employed to store various in-game data.

### Algorithmic Component
The heart of my algorithm revolves around chessboard movements, strategies for capturing opponents, win conditions, and scoring mechanisms.

### Additional Technologies
I've incorporated several other technologies that added value to the project:
- Singletons: Used to manage the game's state and settings consistently. It allowed me to maintain a fullscreen stage and control audio settings.
- Multi-threading: Implemented to introduce a timer in JavaFX, enhancing the game's dynamics.
- SceneBuilder: Despite the learning curve, integrating SceneBuilder enhanced the project's visual elements.

## Challenges Faced
Learning JavaFX posed a challenge, as it wasn't extensively covered in our coursework. It required extra effort to grasp its nuances and effectively implement it within the project.

## Future Progress
Moving forward, there are several areas I would have liked to explore:
- Networked Gameplay: Implementing a multiplayer mode over a network.
- Player vs. Computer Mode: Adding an AI opponent for solo play. Unfortunately, time constraints prevented its implementation in this version.

Feel free to explore, modify, or extend this project for further enhancements.
